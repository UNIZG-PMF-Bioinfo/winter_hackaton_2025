# Santa's Weighty Situation

Ho ho ho... or maybe not so *ho ho ho* this year.\
Santa Claus has been facing **serious health concerns** after an unprecedented rise in cookie consumption last Christmas. 🍪😵

His belt can barely hold, and he has officially outgrown his magical sleigh!\
But even more worrying than his waistline are the **metabolic complications** he's experiencing...

![Cookie season is on!](img_santa/santa_cookie.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A Not-So-Jolly Diagnosis

Unlike most individuals with obesity, Santa's condition shows:

-   **Increased overall adiposity**
-   **Dyslipidemia** (unhealthy blood fats)
-   **Insulin resistance**
-   **Systemic inflammation**

The elves' medical staff are worried that if this continues...\
Santa may not have enough energy to deliver presents around the world! 🎁💔

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What the Science Tells Us

A study by **Le Chatelier et al.** demonstrated that individuals with obesity who have **low gut bacterial richness**\
(also known as **Low Gene Count -- LGC**) experience **more severe metabolic disturbances** compared to those with higher richness (**High Gene Count -- HGC**).

In short:\
\> 🧫 A less diverse microbiome may worsen obesity-related health issues.

Santa's gut microbiota profiles indicate he belongs to the **LGC group** --- which could explain the worrying combination of symptoms he's facing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now it's up to **us** --- the data scientists and microbiome detectives 🕵️🧠 ---\
to build a **machine-learningg model** capable of distinguishing **obese vs. non-obese** individuals based on their gut microbiome profiles.

Because Santa's microbiome data is highly confidential (North Pole GDPR is no joke 🧑‍⚖️🎄),\
you'll only be allowed to **evaluate** it once your model is trained and validated.

Your mission:\
🎯 Predict whether Santa truly belongs to the "obese" group\
🧫 Identify which microbial species are **protective in lean individuals**\
💊 Suggest potential **probiotic interventions** to restore Santa's health

Help Santa regain his energy, lift-off power, and **return to full sleigh-flying strength**! 🚀🛷✨

# Let's Get to Work! 🔬🎄

[Download the dataset](projects/Microbiome_subset.csv.gz)

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Start by carefully examining the microbiome dataset What are some key findings that stand out in your dataset?

Your mission:\
Formulate up to **10 insightful scientific questions**, then explore them using\
meaningful visualizations and summary statistics. Such as Santa asks himself are girls more happier when receiving present wrapped in pink with a glittery bow?

### 🤖 Model Development: Obesity Classification with Microbiome Data

Train **two** machine-learning models capable of predicting whether an individual is **obese vs. non-obese** from microbiome features.

Additionally, develop **two regression models** to predict BMI as a continuous outcome from microbiome features.

Then:

1.  **Compare their performance**
2.  **Select the best model from classification and regression model** to move forward
3.  Identify **which microbial features** are most influential in classification

## Elf Paula's Approval Checkpoint 🧝

Before Santa's confidential data is unlocked,\
you must **submit your best model to the Elf Review Committee™** for approval.

Once the elves confirm that your model meets North Pole regulatory standards (NP-FDA),\
they will provide:

-   Santa's **private** biomedical data in a **independent test set**

Your final task:

🎯 Determine Santa's overweight status with both classification and regresison model\
📈 Assess how well your models generalizes to unseen cases 🍬 How well do unseen cases cluster with the ones used for training 💊 Comment which bacteria should we target to improve Santa's healt
