Could these symptoms --- in combination with years of chimney exposure ---\\\nsignal something more serious lurking behind all that festive cheer? 🎄\n\nBefore Santa panics and trades his sleigh for a hospital bed,\\\nhe's turning to **you** --- the finest machine-learning researchers in the North Pole! 🕵️🤖\n\n![Oh noooo!](img_santa/santa_chimney.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## 🎯 Your Mission\n\nDevelop a **predictive model** that can distinguish **early-stage vs late-stage carcinoma** based on real clinical and gene expression data.\n\nBecause Santa's medical scans and biopsy results are **strictly classified** (sealed in a candy-cane-encrypted vault 🍬🔐),\\\nyou'll only unlock access once your model shows strong performance on the provided training data.\n\nYour task:\n\n-   🧬 Identify the **key clinical features** linked to cancer progression\\\n-   📈 Build and validate a model to classify **carcinoma stage**\\\n-   🔍 Determine whether Santa may require **further clinical examination**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith your help, Santa will breathe freely again (and continue expertly sliding into homes worldwide 😌).\\\nLet's make sure this holiday season remains full of joy --- **not cough drops**! 🌬️🎁✨\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Let's Get to Work! 🔬🎄\n\n[Download the dataset](projects/Lung_cancer_subset.csv.gz)\n\n### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nBegin by thoroughly investigating your dataset and its variables.\\\nLook for patterns, differences between groups, and potential predictors of cancer stage.\n\nYour task:\\\nFormulate up to **10 meaningful scientific questions** and explore them with appropriate visualizations or summary statistics.\n\nSuch as Santa asks himself are girls more happier when receiving present wrapped in pink with a glittery bow?\n\n### 🤖 Model Development: Predicting Carcinoma Stage\n\nBuild **at least three-four** classification models using your training data.\\\n\nThen:\n\n1.  **Compare their performance**\n2.  **Select the best model** to move forward\n3.
