## 🔍✨ Mrs. Claus' Wisdom on Exploratory Analysis

Before you rush through the snowdrifts, remember your **fundamental statistics** --- they are your compass in this frozen landscape.\
Always check the **pre-requirements** of every question you ask; good analysis begins with good understanding. 📚✨

To aid you, I have tucked several useful tools into your sleigh:

-   ⛄ **GGally**\
-   🌟 **ggpubr**\
-   💫 **ggstatsplot**\
-   ❄️ **corrplot**

Alongside your sturdy **base R** knowledge, these will help you uncover hidden patterns beneath the winter frost.

## 🧊🔮 Unsupervised Magic in the Winter Forest

Do not overlook the quiet magic of **unsupervised methods**.\
Whether you wander through:

-   🌲 Hierarchical complete clustering\
-   ✨ PCA or UMAP to carve beautiful shapes in the snow

You will find that these tools can reveal structures no map could show.

For extra sparkle, I recommend:

-   🔥 **pheatmap**\
-   🎁 **factoextra**

Let them add a bit of festive punch to your winter explorations!

*Good machine learning practices are your warm mittens --- never start without them.* 🧤✨

To make your journey smoother, I wholeheartedly recommend the **caret** package.\
It offers quick, tidy, and powerful access to countless ML methods, both simple and advanced. 🎀🤖

Go forth with confidence, my dear researcher.\
🎅❄️ *The spirit of Christmas (and Mrs. Claus) is cheering you on every step of the way!*
