**HO HO HO! 🎄**

Welcome to the very first **Winter Hackathon of 2025**!

But there's a big problem...\
Santa and his elves have all fallen terribly ill, leaving Christmas in *serious* danger! 🤒🎅

The North Pole's medical team has called in **you** --- a group of elite data scientists --- to uncover the source of this mysterious outbreak.

Your mission: 👉 Use machine learning to **identify the key predictors of the illness**\
👉 Develop a **reliable model** to help Santa recover\
👉 Save Christmas for children everywhere! 🎁✨

So grab your festive cookies and milk, turn up the Jingle Bells playlist,\
and let's **code our way to a merry holiday rescue!** ❄️💻

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Hackathon Objective

Collaboratively develop and evaluate a predictive model for your assigned topic, and present your findings to the entire cohort.

Your results will be judged based on:

-   Quality and rigor of your analysis\
-   Clarity and creativity in communicating findings
-   Successful evaluation on an **independent test dataset** where Santa is.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎅 Topics & Teams

| Topic                               | Teams          |
|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Santa's cookie addiction crisis** | Team A, Team B |
| **Santa's smoky chimney syndrome**  | Team C, Team D |

Each team will receive:

-   A training dataset\
-   An independent test dataset (later on)
-   Basic metadata and guidance from the elves (i.e., Paula 😄)
