**HO HO HO! 🎄**

Welcome to the very first **Winter Hackathon of 2025**!  

But there’s a big problem...  
Santa and his elves have all fallen terribly ill, leaving Christmas in *serious* danger! 🤒🎅

The North Pole’s medical team has called in **you** — a group of elite data scientists — to uncover the source of this mysterious outbreak.

Your mission:
👉 Use machine learning to **identify the key predictors of the illness**  
👉 Develop a **reliable model** to help Santa recover  
👉 Save Christmas for children everywhere! 🎁✨

So grab your festive cookies and milk, turn up the Jingle Bells playlist,  
and let’s **code our way to a merry holiday rescue!** ❄️💻

## 🎯 Hackathon Objective

Collaboratively develop and evaluate a predictive model for your assigned topic, and present your findings to the entire cohort.

Your results will be judged based on:

- Quality and rigor of your analysis  
- Clarity and creativity in communicating findings 
- Successful evaluation on an **independent test dataset** where Santa is.

## 🎅 Topics & Teams

| Topic | Teams |
|-------|------|
| **Santa’s cookie addiction crisis** | Team A, Team B |
| **Santa’s smoky chimney syndrome** | Team C, Team D |

Each team will receive:

- A training dataset  
- An independent test dataset (later on) 
- Basic metadata and guidance from the elves (i.e., Paula 😄)

## 📊 Final Presentation Requirements

- Max **15 slides** (template provided)
- You may use fewer slides — **but no more!**
- Clear explanation of:
  - 🎯 Scientific motivation & background
  - 🔍 Data overview & key features
  - 🧪 Modeling strategy
  - 📈 Performance evaluation and comparison
  - 🎁 Key insights, limitations & next steps

Bonus points ✨ for visual polish, creativity, and storytelling — keep that holiday spirit alive!

## ❄️ Teamwork Guidelines

- Divide tasks efficiently (EDA, feature engineering, modeling, visualization, presenting)
- Communicate openly and support each other — Christmas depends on cooperation!
- Ask for clarification when needed — but **you** are leading the sleigh 🚀🛷
