    "text": "Ho ho ho… or maybe not so ho ho ho this year.\nSanta Claus has been facing serious health concerns after an unprecedented rise in cookie consumption last Christmas. 🍪😵\nHis belt can barely hold, and he has officially outgrown his magical sleigh!\nBut even more worrying than his waistline are the metabolic complications he’s experiencing…\n\n\n\nCookie season is on!\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike most individuals with obesity, Santa’s condition shows:\n\nIncreased overall adiposity\nDyslipidemia (unhealthy blood fats)\nInsulin resistance\nSystemic inflammation\n\nThe elves’ medical staff are worried that if this continues…\nSanta may not have enough energy to deliver presents around the world! 🎁💔\n\n\n\n\nA study by Le Chatelier et al. demonstrated that individuals with obesity who have low gut bacterial richness\n(also known as Low Gene Count – LGC) experience more severe metabolic disturbances compared to those with higher richness (High Gene Count – HGC).\nIn short:\n> 🧫 A less diverse microbiome may worsen obesity-related health issues.\nSanta’s gut microbiota profiles indicate he belongs to the LGC group — which could explain the worrying combination of symptoms he’s facing.\n\nNow it’s up to us — the data scientists and microbiome detectives 🕵️🧠 —\nto build a machine-learningg model capable of distinguishing obese vs. non-obese individuals based on their gut microbiome profiles.\nBecause Santa’s microbiome data is highly confidential (North Pole GDPR is no joke 🧑‍⚖️🎄),\nyou’ll only be allowed to evaluate it once your model is trained and validated.\nYour mission:\n🎯 Predict whether Santa truly belongs to the “obese” group\n🧫 Identify which microbial species are protective in lean individuals\n💊 Suggest potential probiotic interventions to restore Santa’s health\nHelp Santa regain his energy, lift-off power, and return to full sleigh-flying strength! 🚀🛷✨"

    "text": "While delivering gifts last Christmas, Santa spent hours squeezing down chimneys,\nexposed to soot, smoke, and cold winter air.\nThis year, the merry old guy has developed a persistent cough, occasional shortness of breath,\nand the elves are worried. Could these symptoms — in combination with years of chimney exposure —\nsignal something more serious lurking behind all that festive cheer? 🎄\nBefore Santa panics and trades his sleigh for a hospital bed,\nhe’s turning to you — the finest machine-learning researchers in the North Pole! 🕵️🤖\n\n\n\nOh noooo!\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop a predictive model that can distinguish early-stage vs late-stage carcinoma based on real clinical and gene expression data.\nBecause Santa’s medical scans and biopsy results are strictly classified (sealed in a candy-cane-encrypted vault 🍬🔐),\nyou’ll only unlock access once your model shows strong performance on the provided training data.\nYour task:\n\n🧬 Identify the key clinical features linked to cancer progression\n\n📈 Build and validate a model to classify carcinoma stage\n\n🔍 Determine whether Santa may require further clinical examination\n\n\nWith your help, Santa will breathe freely again (and continue expertly sliding into homes worldwide 😌).\nLet’s make sure this holiday season remains full of joy — not cough drops! 🌬️🎁✨"
