# Santa Claus Is Coughing...

While delivering gifts last Christmas, Santa spent **hours squeezing down chimneys**,\
exposed to **soot, smoke, and cold winter air**.

This year, the merry old guy has developed a **persistent cough**, occasional **shortness of breath**,\
and the elves are *worried*. Could these symptoms --- in combination with years of chimney exposure ---\
signal something more serious lurking behind all that festive cheer? 🎄

Before Santa panics and trades his sleigh for a hospital bed,\
he's turning to **you** --- the finest machine-learning researchers in the North Pole! 🕵️🤖

![Oh noooo!](img_santa/santa_chimney.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Your Mission

Develop a **predictive model** that can distinguish **early-stage vs late-stage carcinoma** based on real clinical and gene expression data.

Because Santa's medical scans and biopsy results are **strictly classified** (sealed in a candy-cane-encrypted vault 🍬🔐),\
you'll only unlock access once your model shows strong performance on the provided training data.

Your task:

-   🧬 Identify the **key clinical features** linked to cancer progression\
-   📈 Build and validate a model to classify **carcinoma stage**\
-   🔍 Determine whether Santa may require **further clinical examination**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With your help, Santa will breathe freely again (and continue expertly sliding into homes worldwide 😌).\
Let's make sure this holiday season remains full of joy --- **not cough drops**! 🌬️🎁✨

# Let's Get to Work! 🔬🎄

[Download the dataset](projects/Lung_cancer_subset.csv.gz)

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Begin by thoroughly investigating your dataset and its variables.\
Look for patterns, differences between groups, and potential predictors of cancer stage.

Your task:\
Formulate up to **10 meaningful scientific questions** and explore them with appropriate visualizations or summary statistics.

Such as Santa asks himself are girls more happier when receiving present wrapped in pink with a glittery bow?

### 🤖 Model Development: Predicting Carcinoma Stage

Build **at least three-four** classification models using your training data.\

Then:

1.  **Compare their performance**
2.  **Select the best model** to move forward
3.  Which medical **features** are most important for predicting cancer stage?

## Elf Paula's Approval Checkpoint 🧝

Before Santa's confidential data is unlocked,\
you must **submit your best model to the Elf Review Committee™** for approval.

Once the elves confirm that your model meets North Pole regulatory standards (NP-FDA),\
they will provide:

-   Santa's **private** biomedical data in a **independent test set**

Your final task:\
🎯 Determine Santa's predicted cancer stage\
📈 Assess how well your model generalizes to unseen cases 🍬

Let's hope that Santa ends up on the **healthier, happier** side of your classification results ---\
we need him fit for sleigh duty!
